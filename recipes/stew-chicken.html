            <li>
                <p>Put the chicken pieces in a large bowl along with all the marinade ingredients. Toss, then rub the mixture 
                    into the chicken. Cover tightly and chill for 24 hrs
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the chicken and marinade into a deep ovenproof dish. Cover and
