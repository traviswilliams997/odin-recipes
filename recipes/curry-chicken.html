        <h1>Curry Chicken</h1>
        <img src ="../img/curry.png" alt="A plate of curry chicken">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious, easy, curry chicken dish cooked entirely in a slow cooker. It's even better one or two days later, as leftovers. 
           Your family will love it! Serve curry chicken over rice, with naan bread and a salad and you have a wonderful meal (I serve it 
           over brown rice)
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2¼ pounds whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 potato, diced</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped carrots</li>
            <li>2 scallions (green onions), chopped</li>
            <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced</li>
            <li>1 Scotch bonnet chile pepper, chopped, or to taste</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Step 1
                   </strong>
                </p>
                <p>Whisk 2 tablespoons curry powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, onion powder, 
                salt, thyme leaves, allspice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken and 
                coat with curry mixture until curry mixture is wet and sticks to chicken.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Step 2
                   </strong>
                   </p>
                <p>Heat oil and 2 tablespoons curry powder in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until oil is hot and curry powder
                 changes color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken to the hot oil mixture and reduce heat to medium. Add water, potato, carrots, 
                 scallions, ginger, and chile pepper to skillet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Step 2
                   </strong>
                </p>
                <p>Cover skillet and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and gravy is thickened, allowing chicken to cook 
                undisturbed for last 15 minutes of cooking, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of 
                the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a serving dish; continue simmering gravy, 
                uncovered, to thicken (if needed). Serve chicken with gravy.
