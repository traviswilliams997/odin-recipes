        <h1>Ackee and Saltfish</h1>
        <img src ="../img/ackee-saltfish.png" alt="A plate of ackee and saltfish">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ackee and saltfish is Jamaica's national dish, and makes the perfect breakfast or brunch. 
            The nutty taste of the lobes of ackee is complemented perfectly by the sharp salinity and 
            firm texture of salt cod.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces (225g) salt cod</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) diced yellow onion, from 1/4 onion</li>
            <li>2 heaping tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) diced bell pepper, from 1/2 bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 Scotch bonnet chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 small tomato (about 2 ounces; 55g), cored and diced</li>
            <li>1 scallion (10g), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (3g) fresh thyme leaves and tender stems, chopped</li>
            <li>One 18 to 20-ounce can ackee
            </li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>Sliced avocado, for serving
            </li>
         
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Rinse salt cod under cold running water until any salt on its surface is washed away. Transfer to a 
                    medium bowl and cover with fresh water. Soak at room temperature for 1 hour, or cover and refrigerate overnight. 
                    Drain salt cod, discard soaking water, transfer fish to a small saucepan, and cover with fresh water. Bring to a 
                    boil over medium-high heat, and cook until fish flakes easily when prodded with a fork, about 40 minutes. Taste, 
                    and if the cod is still too salty—it should have a similar salinity to bacon—drain and discard cooking water,
                     return fish to saucepan, cover with a fresh change of water, and boil for an additional 20 minutes. Once the 
                     salt cod is cooked and seasoned to your liking, drain, and flake fish into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces, discarding 
                     any bones and silvery membranes. Set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a 12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, Scotch bonnet, and 
                    garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the flaked salt cod and cook, stirring occasionally, until fish is heated through, about 5 minutes.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add tomato, scallion, and thyme, stir to combine, and cook until vegetables are tender and mixture is aromatic, about 5 minutes.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add ackee, stir gently to incorporate, taking care not to over-mix which can cause the ackee to become mushy, and cook until 
                    ackee is heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately with sliced avocado alongside.
